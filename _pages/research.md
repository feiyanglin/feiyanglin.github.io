<!-- I am an algebraic geometer and my research is motivated by classical questions such as the Brill-Noether theory for curves and rationality questions. I also like learning about moduli spaces and algebraic stacks, such as moduli spaces of vector bundles and Quot schemes.  -->
I am interested in many different aspects of algebraic geometry. Currently, I am working on some questions related to the singularities of splitting loci, which led me to think about Quot schemes and hyper-Quot schemes on P^1.

  <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03519">A Borel-Weil-Bott Theorem for Quot Schemes on P^1</a>, with Ajay Gautam and <a href = "https://users.ictp.it/~ssinha1/">Shubham Sinha</a>.
</summary>
<hr>
We study the cohomology groups of tautological bundles on Quot schemes over the projective line, which parametrize rank r quotients of a vector bundle V on P^1. Our main result is an analogue of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem for Quot schemes. As a corollary, we prove recent conjectures of Marian, Oprea, and Sam on the exterior and symmetric powers of tautological bundles.

  <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26044">When are splitting loci Gorenstein?</a>
</summary>
<hr>
Splitting loci are certain natural closed substacks of the stack of vector bundles on P^1, which have found interesting applications in the Brill-Noether theory of k-gonal curves. In this paper, we completely characterize when splitting loci, as algebraic stacks, are Gorenstein or ℚ-Gorenstein. The main ingredients of the proof are a computation of the class groups of splitting loci in certain affine extension spaces, and a formula for the class of their canonical module.

  Resolving the Singularities of Splitting Loci (<a href = "https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.01233">Preprint</a>, <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_sfoP1nyydTrUMkMLXd7u8wnh3ITVM6/view?usp=share_link">Poster</a>).
</summary>
<hr>
We construct modular resolutions of singularities for splitting loci, and use them to show that tame splitting loci have rational singularities. As a corollary of our results and Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory, we prove that if C is a general k-gonal curve, the components of W^r_d(C) have rational singularities. We also recover the classical Gieseker-Petri theorem. Along the way, we prove a cohomology vanishing statement for certain tautological vector bundles on Quot schemes on P^1, which may be of independent interest.

  <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11839">Two Formulas for F-Polynomials</a>, with Gregg Musiker and Tomoki Nakanishi. International Mathematics Research Notices (2023), rnad074.
</summary>
<hr>
We discuss a product formula for F-polynomials in cluster algebras, and provide two proofs. One proof is inductive and uses only the mutation rule for F-polynomials. The other is based on the Fock-Goncharov decomposition of mutations. We conclude by expanding this product formula as a sum and illustrate applications. This expansion provides an explicit combinatorial computation of F-polynomials in a given seed that depends only on the c-vectors and g-vectors along a finite sequence of mutations from the initial seed to the given seed.

  <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10128">Symmetric Group Action of the Birational R-matrix</a>, with Sunita Chepuri. Journal of Combinatorics 14 (2023), no. 2, 213-256.
</summary>
<hr>
The birational R-matrix is a transformation that appears in the theory of geometric crystals, the study of total positivity in loop groups, and discrete dynamical systems. This R-matrix gives rise to an action of the symmetric group S_m on an m-tuple of vectors. While the birational R-matrix is precisely the formula corresponding to the action of the simple transposition si, explicit formulas for the action of other permutations are generally not known. One particular case was studied by Lam and Pylyavskyy as it relates to energy functions of crystals. In this paper, we will discuss formulas for several additional cases, including transpositions, and provide combinatorial interpretations for the functions that appear in our work.

  <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09443">On Virtually Cohen-Macaulay Simplicial Complexes</a>, with Nathan Kenshur, Sean McNally, Zixuan Xu and Teresa Yu. Journal of Algebra 631(2023), 120-135.
</summary>
<hr>
We examine virtual resolutions of Stanley-Reisner ideals for a product of projective spaces. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions for a simplicial complex to be virtually Cohen-Macaulay (to have a virtual resolution with length equal to its codimension). We also show that all balanced simplicial complexes are virtually Cohen-Macaulay.

  <summary>
  <a href = "https://scholarship.claremont.edu/hmc_theses/251/">On Rank-Two and Affine Cluster Algebras</a>, Undergraduate Senior Thesis (2021).
</summary>
<hr>
Motivated by existing results about the Kronecker cluster algebra, this thesis is concerned with two families of cluster algebras, which are two different ways of generalizing the Kronecker case: rank-two cluster algebras, and cluster algebras of type A_{n,1}. Regarding rank-two cluster algebras, our main result is a conjectural bijection that would prove the equivalence of two combinatorial formulas for cluster variables of rank-two skew-symmetric cluster algebras. We identify a technical result that implies the bijection and make partial progress towards its proof. We then shift gears to study certain power series which arise as limits of ratios of F-polynomials in cluster algebras of type A_{n,1}.
